1. Executive Summary
FlexTime is Motion Mechanics’ adaptive operational model designed to align physiotherapy service delivery with real-world patient availability, therapist well-being, and financial sustainability.
The framework:
Optimizes daily shift structure around Dhaka and Savar traffic patterns

Supports continuous physiotherapy coverage with structured breaks

Scales staffing gradually using well-defined tiers

Enables rapid forecasting through a companion interactive microsite

Ensures high clinical quality and economic viability from day one

This document presents the core FlexTime design, staffing model, and high-level financial expectations.

2. FlexTime Daily Structure
2.1 Overview of Daily Blocks
FlexStart — 09:00 to 10:00
 Preparation, team sync, emergencies, light assessments.
FlexShift A — 10:00 to 13:00
 High clinical complexity. Neuro and Foundation sessions peak here.
Midday Reset — 13:00 to 14:00
 Buffer for turnover, sanitization, staff reset.
FlexShift B — 14:00 to 17:00
 Follow-up and pediatric demand peak. Balanced load.
Commute Gap — 17:00 to 19:00
 Strategically bypassing Savar/CRP traffic and allowing therapist recovery.
FlexShift C — 19:00 to 22:00
 After-office accessibility. Express and Premium sessions perform strongly.
FlexShift Z — 06:00 to 09:00 (Tier 3+)
 Future phase early-morning block for athletes, schools, and specialty programs.

3. Bed Capacity and Service Mix
3.1 Standard Bed Allocation
Neuro: 3

MSK: 2

Pediatrics: 2

3.2 50 Percent Launch Capacity (Optional)
Neuro: 2

MSK: 1

Pediatrics: 1

This configuration supports 40 to 55 percent occupancy while minimizing early-month payroll strain.
3.3 Clinical Session Types
Foundation (60 minutes): Full assessment and complex cases

Standard (30 to 45 minutes): Follow-up treatment

Premium Recovery (60 minutes): Advanced combined sessions

Express (15 to 20 minutes): High-throughput, evening-friendly model

Baseline visit mix:
 20% Foundation, 50% Standard, 25% Premium, 5% Express

4. Staffing Tier Framework
FlexTime grows gradually using five staffing tiers. Each tier unlocks specific service capabilities and determines safe occupancy levels.
Tier 0 — Minimum Viable Opening Team
10 Full Time / 4 Part Time (Total 14)
 Supports:
50% bed capacity

Basic coverage of A, B, and C shifts

Tier 1 — Stable Launch Team
14 Full Time / 7 Part Time (Total 21)
 Supports:
Reliable A, B, and C coverage

Evening operations

Early-stage stability

Tier 2 — Baseline Full Operations (Original Staffing Design)
17 Full Time / 9 Part Time (Total 26)
 Supports:
All 7 beds fully active

Full FlexTime operations

Floaters and backup redundancy

CareBridge program

60% performance target
 This is the official baseline for Motion Mechanics.

Tier 3 — Expanded Operations
22 Full Time / 6 Part Time (Total 28)
 Unlocks:
FlexShift Z (06:00 to 09:00)

Partial weekend service

Basic home-care dispatch
