 Welcome to Motion Mechanics: Healing Reimagined
Welcome to Motion Mechanics, a new-era healthcare ecosystem where science meets empathy and play. We are not just a clinic; we are a "planet" of the Purrfect Universe—a collective of builders, healers, and dreamers committed to proving that a company can be a living, caring universe.
Our mission is singular: To reimagine physiotherapy, one healing touch at a time.
Based on the historic soil of Savar's CRP Road, we are building the future of rehabilitation on the same ground where the dream was born. This isn't just a job or a service; it's a declaration that healthcare can be fair, modern, and joyful. We are where healing meets rebellion, and work feels like purpose.
Our Clinical Philosophy: Integrated & Uncompromising
We are an integrated rehabilitation hub, not a general clinic. We provide highly specialized, evidence-based care across our core divisions, all under one roof:
Neurology Unit
Musculoskeletal (MSK) Unit
Paediatrics Unit
Our standard is excellence, rooted in evidence-based practice. We have zero tolerance for clinical malpractice. Our care is led by Senior Physiotherapy Specialists who provide robust clinical mentoring, supervision, and training to ensure the highest ethical and quality standards are upheld for every patient, every time.
Our Method: Technology-Driven & Paperless
We are clinician-innovators building a paperless service. We reject inefficient, outdated systems. Our workplace is fluent and tech-friendly, designed to maximize time with patients, not paperwork.
Software-Driven Workflow: We use digitalized clinical documentation for all patient assessments and treatment planning.
Secure Access: This system allows both physios and patients to securely access essential data, creating a transparent and collaborative healing journey.
Modern Tools: We integrate modern rehabilitation devices and assistive technologies into our practice.
AI-Integration: All employees are equipped with Google Workspace Enterprise and Gemini Advanced AI to support research, documentation, and workflow automation.
Our People & Culture: The Well-Being Pact
We are guardians of a "Well-Being First" policy. We are building an environment that heals its own healers, and we back this promise with constitutional rules.
The 40-Hour Max Workweek: We strictly maintain a 40-hour maximum workweek. There is no unpaid overtime, ever.
Rest is a Right: We believe leave is a right, not a favor. "Leave guilt" is considered a violation of our culture.
Comprehensive Leave: Our leave policies are designed for a full life:
12 Weeks Maternity Leave
4 Weeks Paternity Leave
15 Days Sick Leave
12 Days Casual Leave
20 Days Annual/Earned Leave
Your Whole Self: We don't hire you to fit in; we hire you to stand out. We are a home for clinicians, musicians, researchers, and storytellers—a place where your whole self belongs.
Our System: Fair By Design
Our culture is possible because our system is built for fairness. We are governed by the Purrfect Universe Constitution, which legally binds us to these principles:
People Over Profit: Our net profit margin is constitutionally capped at 5%.
Profit Reinvestment: All surplus profit is redistributed back to the ecosystem:
40% → Employee Well-being
30% → Research & Innovation
20% → Community & Environment
10% → Emergency Reserves
A Real Voice: Employees have a protected, constitutional Right to Voice. We are not a top-down hierarchy. Every 25 employees elect one representative to the Council of the Universe, the central governing body that oversees profit distribution and constitutional compliance.
Radical Transparency: We operate with Radical Candor. All feedback is open and named (no anonymous channels) , and all employees are protected from retaliation. Our salary scales are transparent and public.
Our Commitment to Growth
We invest in our people. We are dedicated to Continuous Professional Development (CPD). We ensure our team grows by providing:
Funded Training: Access to funded certifications, workshops, and conferences.
Mentorship: A clear path for growth, with senior specialists mentoring junior clinicians.
Research & Development (R & D): Opportunities to participate in R&D, cross-planet training, and innovation projects.
The Invitation
Motion Mechanics is our declaration that we can heal people, heal systems, and heal ourselves—all at the same time.
We are building a Universe of trust, care, and play. Join the movement. Heal with us.
